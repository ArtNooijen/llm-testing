7,mistral:7b,remote,2025-11-07 09:31:02,1.15,136,678,111,0.163,0.036," That's a philosophical question!

The complete lyrics are:\n\n""What is this life if, full of care,\nWe have no time to stand and stare.\nNo time to stand beneath the boughs\nAnd watch the blossom shake awake;\nOr to sit in quiet thinking\nBeside the stream on a warm day with\nOur feet inflamed by the napisan water,\nTo see how horses' hooves shatter\nThe plashy mirrors of the brook, or haze\nUpon the long field striae of green.\nWhat is this life if you cannot hear,\nThe little silent solemn moon swell,\nUp over our heads like a silver bell,\nOr see the orange full circular sun\nClimb slow above the hectic dune,\nAnd feel behind you breathings of your joyous friends,\nArise, as well as robins rising at the red light through\nThe Tamar Valley to the summons of the morn?\nWhat is this life if winter comes, can spring be far behind?""\n\nThis poem emphasizes the importance of taking time to appreciate nature and beauty around us. In the context of your question, it seems like the response is suggesting that when there's not much else to do, one should dance as a means of expressing joy and connecting with life."
